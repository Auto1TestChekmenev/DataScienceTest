This is a repository for the data science challenge 


Hello guys!

There are two options for you:

1. The ready-made test with all the answers and with all the code is in the a1Test.html file. 
2. You can download everything and run the a1Test.Rmd file where the full code is. This is just a Rmarkdown document that would produce the same html.

If you have any questions or anything doesn't work, simply write me back. 

My R version is:

version.string R version 3.4.4 (2018-03-15)
nickname       Someone to Lean On          

Packages' versions:

caret 6.0 - 78
data.table 1.10.4-3
dplyr 0.7.4
Hmisc 4.1 - 1
